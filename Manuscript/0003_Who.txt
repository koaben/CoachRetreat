#Who

The main misunderstanding about CoachRetreat is that it's exclusive for coaches. We have to admit the name CoachRetreat is not helping.
So if it's not exclusive for coaches and scrummasters, who is it for?

In short anyone who want to practise having a coaching conversation. Yes that is basicially almost everyone.

I remember welcomming agile coaches, delivery managers, developers, educators, product owners, product managemers, project managers, scrummasters, testers, trainers and even some c-level people.
