## Tips for CoachRetreat facilitators

Before you facilitate a CoachRetreat we highly recommend that you participate in one. 
That way you will feel the atmosphere and the energy that typically is part of one. 


The most important tip: CoachRetreat is not for you to learn and or show off.
Yes you will hear things and you will learn. 
Your main goal is to create the safe environment where others can learn.
When you succeed at that, your participants will love the event and thus remember you. 

When during a debrief moment someone asks a question directly at you, your first words should be along the lines of: what do others think of this. It's very tempting to be the first to answer. You can still give another answer if (and only if) you have something to add. Yet do remember to refer to the answers given by participants. Doing so, will generally increase trust. 

In the beginning, it’s very important to go to all subgroups and explicitly tell them when t’s time to swap for another exercise.
