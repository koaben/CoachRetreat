#Intro

You don't get a second chance to create a first impression. 
As a facilitator during the intro you set the tone of the rest of the event.
It's very important to ask everyone to state their name and state what is for them an acceptance criteria of CoachRetreat.
People who talking during the first 5 minutes of an event talk more during the rest of the day. 
This is important for both introverts and extroverts. Introvert have overcome that first hurdle to talk and extroverts now also know what the goal of the others are.
