##Supplies

We don't need much supplies for a CoachRetreat

+ normal paper for observers
+ pens
+ post it's for the AHA wall
+ markers
+ Projector with laptop for the CoachRetreat slides. Alternatively you may prepare Flipchart sheets with the intro and exercises.
+ Printed version of the stories on large papers. (in the local language)
+ timers: you can use Timetimers
+ If you want to offer a painting session, you need to bring all painting canvasses, paint and lots of plastic to protect the room where you will do this. 
+ Dot votes stickers if you want to reuse the stories. 
+ Flipchart and masking tape is useful for the retrospective after each round.
+ Books. Itâ€™s always nice to have some book about coaching and conversations available at a CoachRetreat.
