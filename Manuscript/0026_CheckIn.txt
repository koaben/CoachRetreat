##Check in

We use the Check in exercice of the Core Protocols from the book Software for Your Head by Jim and Michele McCarthy.

Successively each participant says "I feel [one or more of MAD, SAD, GLAD, AFRAID]" and may add a brief explanation. Then she says "I'm in.". The others respond "Welcome."

This quick connection allows everybody to observe his/her internal state and share it with the group. This activity opens the day with an authentic welcome and benevolent atmosphere.
