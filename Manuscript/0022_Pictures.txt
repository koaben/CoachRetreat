#Pictures

It's very important to ask the particpants if they are ok with taking pictures at the start of the event. 

Sometimes emotions can be high during CoachRetreat, you might not see it while people are busy. If you take a picture at such a moment they might get upset.

Make sure you also tell them what will you do with the pictures.
For some it might be nice to have a set of pictures of the day.
