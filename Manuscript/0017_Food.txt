##Food & Beverages

There are multiple options for food during CoachRetreat.

The best results we had in France with a shared lunch: every participant brig something to share for the lunch. In France this is something called "The Neighbouroughs' Party" : once a year, on a Saturday, the neighboroughs meet and greet and cook for all the community. As a bundle, when registering there was a link for the a doodle where participants entered the kind of  food they were willing to bring, and they had a view of anything that was already proposed.
Alos, we noticed that on the events where people brought their own food, the quota of no-shows was close to zero. We assume that offering to either bring foof or dinks, is a kind of engagement that motivates the presence. 

If this way to organize linch is not possible, then itâ€™s best to have a sponsor taking care of the food.

+ croissants etc in the morning
+ pizza or something else pretty easy to eat and not so heavy for lunch. 
+ Coffee, fruit-juice, water and non alcoholic beverages should be available during the full event for free.
