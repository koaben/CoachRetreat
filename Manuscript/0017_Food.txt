##Food & Beverages

There are multiple options for food during CoachRetreat.

The best results we had in France with BYOF (Bring Your Own Food) 
We asked the participants as a kind of ticket to bring food. As they wanted to avoid to have too much the same, participants discussed beforehand and thus there was a bond already before the event.
On top we noticed that on the events where people brought their own food, we had the least of none-shows. Our fantasy is it was either because of the promise or the preparation the day before. 

If BYOF is not possible, then itâ€™s best to have a sponsor taking care of the food.

+ croissants etc in the morning
+ pizza or something else pretty easy to eat and not so heavy for lunch. 
+ Coffee, fruit-juice, water and non alcoholic beverages should be available during the full event for free.
