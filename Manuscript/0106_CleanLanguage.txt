##Clean Language

###Intro

When we talk, our words carry our thoughts, beliefs and perceptions. If we want to really listen to someone, it's worth "cleaning" our language, that is removing OUR stuff from what we say. So that we are not influencing the other, our attitude could be equivalent to pure curiosity. The Clean Language is based on this principle: asking questions to help the coachee explore by him/herself with NONE of our interpretation or intention, as we want to let all the space for the coachee.
