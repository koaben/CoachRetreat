#What is a CoachRetreat?

CoachRetreat = Coaching Dojo + Code Retreat 

Coaching Dojo, created by Rachel Davies, focused on 1-session practicing on 'agile coaching problem' Kata by groups : 1 seeker (brings the problem), a pair of coaches (or a team of coaches) and observers. At the end of the session, the observers give feedback about the coaching style and suggest improvements.

Code Retreat, co-created by Corey Haines, focused on learning by repeating the same 'software development problem' Kata over 45 min length sessions followed by retrospective along a whole Saturday.

A CoachRetreat is a one day workshop, where people can experiment and improve their coaching skills on katas. 

We love feedback loops. CoachRetreat has 5 different feedback loops.

+ ClickRewind lets people try saying something and replay that situation multiple times
+ During the retrospective of a technique, you have the second feedback loop
+ When you replay a story with a different coaching technique, you have a third feedback loop
+ The end of the day retro is another feedback loop
+ When people come to another CoachRetreat, they get a fifth feedback loop.
