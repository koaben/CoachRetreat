#Stories

In this chapter, you can read all the stories that participants can choose from.
The idea is to give you one page per story that you as an organiser can print. If you decide to translate the stories to your local language, please ask for editing right and you can add your translation to our manual.

The stories contain names to make it easier to talk about these scenarios. Yet we on purpose don't define which person in these stories is the one that is coached. Everytime a session is launched, the coach and coachee can agree on who to coach.
