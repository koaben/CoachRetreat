##Yes And

###Intro
Are you familiar with the concept, from improve theater, of “yes, and…”? It’s a skill that is useful in leadership and in life. It helps if you’re on stage giving a presentation to 100 people, and it helps when you are in conversation with one person. Instead of shutting down the options in the conversation by saying “Yes, but…” try using “Yes, and…” to build on the idea. 

When anyone in the room (except the coachee) hears a "but" or something similar, we use the Click! protocol. We explain how the person has said it, and then we ask them to rewind to before they said that sentence. 

The “yes, and” rule is for both the coach and the coachee.
