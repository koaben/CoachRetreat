##Aha Wall

During CoachRetreat we use an aha wall to collect the idea’s the participants learn or want to share with each other.

It’s important to talk about the aha-wall during the intro of the day and during every retro session during the day. 
At the end of the day It’s a good idea to walk over to the board and read the different post it’s.
