#What is a CoachRetreat?

##CoachRetreat = Coaching Dojo + Code Retreat 

Coaching Dojo, created by Rachel Davies, focused on 1-session practicing on 'agile coaching problem' Kata by groups : 1 seeker (brings the problem), a pair of coaches (or a team of coaches) and observers. At the end of the session, the observers give feedback about the coaching style and suggest improvements.

Code Retreat, co-created by Coray Haynes, focused on learning by repeating the same 'software development problem' Kata over 45 min length sessions followed by retrospective along a whole saturday.

A CoachRetreat is a one day workshop, where people can experiment and improve their coaching skills on katas.
