# Foreword {#Foreword}

In 2011 I organised the first CoachRetreat, on the request of Jurgen Desmet. 
After I wrote a blogpost about it, Oana Juncu contacted me. 

She loved the idea and she imagined a new format. Her proposal is the format we had use today. What we have done at the fist COachRetrat was something totally different, yet her idea was so much better. Hence CoachRetreat 2.0 was born. 

Oana & me, went on to co-organise the next CoachRetreat in Paris. The next 5 years, more than 30 CoachRetreats were organised in 12 different countries by 20 different facilitators. 

This manual was created to help people that want to have a local CoachRetreat. 

If anything is not clear, feel free to ask questions to one of the authors, facilitators personally or (preferable) on the CoachRetreat mailing list, where you can find all of us.

Enjoy
