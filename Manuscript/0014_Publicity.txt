##Spred the word

These days, there are so many events asking for our time and attention, that we really need to make our own publicity for community events. At the same time, we have also many tools so that we can easily do it as a community. 

Things you can use to make publicty:

+ Our mailinglist
+ Eventbrite 
+ AgileConferenc.es (The google calendars that Yves created and are now maintained by +200 people.)
+ Twitter (hashtag #CoachRetreat #CRXXX where xxx is the number of the event. )
+ Linkedin
+ the people you work with
+ your local community
+ The international community
+ A global CoachRetreat meetup ....

If you have other idea's for making publicity, let us know, so we can update this booklet.
