##Language

The hardest rule for CoachRetreat organizers is the language. Yves is convinced that learning to listen to someone is already hard enough in our mothertongue. Hence he insists that CoachRetreat is organized in one language.

Of course people can follow a CoachRetreat in another language than their mothertongue. Yet we do encourage you to first follow one in your mothertongue. On the facilitator page you can find people who can help you organizing one.
