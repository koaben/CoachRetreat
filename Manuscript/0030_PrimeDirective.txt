##Prime Directive

Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone does the best job they can, given what they know at the time, their skills and abilities, the people and resources available, and the situation at hand. 

At the end of today everyone will know so much more. Naturally we will discover decisions and actions we wish we could do over. This is wisdom to be celebrated, not judgment used to embarrass.
