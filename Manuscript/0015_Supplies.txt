##Supplies

We don't need much supplies for a CoachRetreat

+ name tags (preferable textile)  
+ normal paper for observers
+ pens
+ post it's for the AHA wall
+ markers
+ Projector with laptop for the CoachRetreat slides. Alternatively you may prepare Flipchart sheets with the intro and exercises.
+ Loud Speakers: we have video as a support to explain the coachretreat, so you may want to play it.
+ Printed version of the stories on large papers. (in the local language)
+ timers: you can use Timetimers
+ If you want to offer a painting session, you need to bring all painting canvasses, paint and lots of plastic to protect the room where you will do this. 
+ Dot votes stickers if you want to reuse the stories. 
+ Flipchart and masking tape is useful for the retrospective after each round.
+ Books. Itâ€™s always nice to have some book about coaching and conversations available at a CoachRetreat.
+ Make sure you have the enterance code for the building you are using
+ Have the telephone number of a contact person of the venue. 
+ Goodie bag: sometimes sponsors want to distribute stuff. Make sure you have a conversation about that up front. 
+ Inspiration pictures.
