##Painting Room

In the very first CoachRetreat we had a room, where people could do a conversation while painting.
The goal was not to create nice paitings. (we actually throw them away) The idea of this activity is thatactivating another part of our brain, we might have other kind of conversations. 
For logistically reasons most CoachRetreats don't have a painting room. 

In Israel in 2012 we had a painting room which was briefly used in the first round, and then turned into a regular working space. This is OK: If you choose to have a painting room, don't get frustrated if this is eventually not used.

Nevertheless, painting may be very exhaustingfor the participants. In Paris, we have experienced one session among all during the day, with conversations while painting, and people found it as the hardest one. Keep in mind that activating multiple parts of the brain in the same time is not something we are used too, and the activity is just as exhausting as doing intensive sports you're not used to do.
