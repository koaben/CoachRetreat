##Intro

You don't get a second chance to create a first impression. 
As a facilitator during the intro you set the tone of the rest of the event.

As a facilitator, you welcome people, you do the intro and introduce the name of the techniques, and more explanation if no one knows it. 
The goal of a CoachRetreat is NOT to teach a technique. 

We want people to practice a technique. Both experienced people as newbies.

Some people might feel uncomfortable with just a brief intro of a technique, they will push to have a longer intro. Don’t do it. There are a few problems with trying.

+ You probably don’t have the right training to explain the technique. (So what you say might make it worse)
+ We don’t have the time in a CoachRetreat
+ And most important, no matter how much time you take, it will never be enough. 

You are much better to propose to them to observe others and see how it works. And when they feel comfortable to try themselves. 

Again the goal of a CoachRetreat is not to make them (or yourself) fully experts. It’s to experiment with techniques in a safe environment.
