##Location

As my friend Jan Pellegrims says: location, location, location. 
A good location is crucial for CoachRetreat.
The good news is, as CoachRetreat is usually taking place on a Saturday, it’s pretty easy to find a good location. 

###Now what is a good location?

+ People can enter this location without much hassle.
+ Has enough parking spots, preferable free parking.
+ Is reachable by public transport.
+ Has a room to welcome everyone.
In this place we should be able to hang the different Stories at the walls.
+ The welcoming place has a large screen or a projector. To show the slides. 
+ Next to the welcoming room, it also has a a few small places where people can have the coaching conversations. We consider 4 to 6 people per room. So for 24 people, you would minimum need 4 of these places, preferable 6. 
+ The location should also have a place were the participants can eat. 
+ Preferable a location with lots of windows and great view. 
+ Sometimes people do coaching conversations while walking, for that you would need a garden or a place where it’s safe to walk in groups of 4.
+ If you want to have a coaching session, while painting, you need a room where it’s safe to do this.
