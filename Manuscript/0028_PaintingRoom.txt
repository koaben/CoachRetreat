##Painting Room

In the very first CoachRetreat we had a room, where people could do a conversation while painting.
The goal was not to create nice paitings. (we actually throw them away) The idea behind this room is that by activating another part of our brain, we might have other kind of conversations. 
For logistically reasons most CoachRetreats don't have a painting room. 

In Israel in 2012 we had a painting room which was briefly used in the first round, and then turned into a regular working space. This is OK: If you choose to have a painting room, don't get frustrated if this is eventually not used.
