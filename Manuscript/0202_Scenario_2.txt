##Scenario 2

In a large company, **Jean-Louis**, a young manager is appreciated for his efficiency.

He has led projects to completion on time and well communicated with the top management. He was given a team of developers who now must work using Agile methods. 

The CIO **Luc**, takes keen interest in the Agile approach. The internal customer (marketing) is the main promoter, because Agile brings them quick results cheaper.

Jean-Louis gives a lot of value to the quality of reporting, he read that Scrum provides indicators for team performance (velocity).

Team members have to provide indicators of progress daily to update the burn-down charts. **Louise**, the PO challenges the estimates in story points. The team concluded that Scrum is a constrictive-control method.

You arrive in this context to coach the team for “high performance”. 

Jean-Louis’s goal is to have visibility. He expects you to enable increased visibility.
Louise still sees little of the future...
