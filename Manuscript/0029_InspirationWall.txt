##Inspiration Wall

Just like an aha wall, we use an inspiration wall, to collect all kind of inspirations that participants want to share with each other. 

Itâ€™s important to talk about the Inspiration-wall during the intro of the day and during every retro session during the day. 

Make sure you make pictures of the wall at the end of the day, so yu can share the inspirations with everyone.
