##Check in

We use the Check in exercise of the Core Protocols from the book Software for Your Head by Jim and Michele McCarthy.

Successively each participant says "I feel [one or more of MAD, SAD, GLAD, AFRAID]" and may add a brief explanation. Then she says "I'm in.". The others respond "Welcome."

This quick connection allows everybody to observe his/her internal state and share it with the group. This activity opens the day with an authentic welcome and benevolent atmosphere.

In this check in, only the 4 basic emotions are allowed. (Or a combination of these four)
Sometimes a person who does this for the first time, has a hard time to only select these four emotions.

You might think that these are 3 negative emotions and one positive emotion. That’s not the case, emotions are a state. They just are. We give them a positive or negative connotation. 

When we think of a people who is MAD, we imagine a person screaming. Hence we think it’s a bad idea to express that we are mad. Actually the opposite is true. People who are screaming mad, have waited to long to express that they are mad. 

Some people have the idea that we can leave emotions at the door. We can’t. We are a whole person. By stating our initial state at the beginning, we allow ourselfs and our co-participants to be fully present.  

Because of the tendency to think there are negative and positive emotions, a participant might say something like: a little mad or very glad. We don’t allow that. It’s important to state the emotions without qualifiers. By stating I ‘m mad about yyy, people feel and accept that emotion more. 

Especially for a CoachRetreat it’s important to insist on this. 

It’s also important to notice that the goal of a check in, is not to have a conversation about his. 
The goal is to be fully present.


###Example:

Yves: I’ll check in. \\
I’m glad I’m here today \\
I’m sad I will not be with my family today \\
I’m glad & afraid there are so many participants today. \\
I’m mad I stayed up so late yesterday preparing for today and I’m afraid I will be tired. \\
I’m glad because I know that is my default behaviour for a CoachRetreat. \\
I’m sad we have people who subscribed who did not show up or cancelled their subscription. \\
I’m sad and glad Bart cancelled on time, allowing me to invite Bernard from the waiting list. \\
I’m glad Bernard did make it, even if I only invited him yesterday. \\
I’m in.

Others: Welcome.


The order in which people check in, is not important. It’s important not to force people to check in in a certain order. Give them time. 
People can pass. Yet they have to say it:

###Example:

Esther: I’ll check in, I’ll pass. I’m in.  

The “I’ll check in” and the “I’m in” give it a very sense of an AA meeting. Don’t skip it, it makes it clearer when people will start talking or have finished checking in.
