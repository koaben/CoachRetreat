## Tips for CoachRetreat facilitators

The most important tip: CoachRetreat is not for you to learn and or show off.
Yes you will hear things and you will occasionally learn. 
Your main goal is to create the safe environment where others can learn.

When during a debrief moment you get asked a qestion, your first words should be along the lines of: what do others think of this. It's very tempting to be the first to answer. Hey, you are the facilitator right?
