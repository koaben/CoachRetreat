# Foreword {#Foreword}

In 2011 I organised the first CoachRetreat, on the request of Jurgen Desmet. 
After I wrote a blogpost about it, Oana Juncu contacted me. 

She loved the idea and she had a fantasy about the format that we had used. We actually did something totally different, yet her idea was so much better. Hence CoachRetreat 2.0 was born. 

Oana & me, we went on to co-organise the next CoachRetreat in Paris. The next 5 years, more then 30 CoachRetreats were organised in 12 different countries by 20 different facilitators. 

This manual was created to help people that want to have a local CoachRetreat. 

If anything is not clear, feel free to ask questions to one of the authors, facilitators personally or (preferable) on the CoachRetreat mailing list, where you can find all of us.

Enjoy
