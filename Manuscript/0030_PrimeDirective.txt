##Prime Directive

The prime directive was published by xxx in his book about project retrospectives.
The version below is adapted, to not talk about the past, yet about the future, aka the day of teh CoachRetreat.
To tell people, please look positive at everyone, we want people to experiment today with things they don't dare yet in the outside world. So yes they might say stupid things or things they don't believe because they play a role. 

So you might want to put this statement on the wall and or read it out loud. 

Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone does the best job they can, given what they know at the time, their skills and abilities, the people and resources available, and the situation at hand. 

At the end of today everyone will know so much more. Naturally we will discover decisions and actions we wish we could do over. This is wisdom to be celebrated, not judgment used to embarrass.
