##Painting Room

In the very first CoachRetreat we had a room, where people could do a conversation while painting.
The goal was not to create nice paitings. (we actually throw them away) The idea behind this room is that by activating another part of our brain, we might have other kind of conversations. 
For logistically reasons most CoachRetreats don't have a painting room.
