##Slides

During CoachRetreat we use a very limited set of slides. 
The slides we have normally contain little to no text. (Typically a word or two per topic)
Of course as an organizer you are free to make your own slides. 
On our Dropbox folder, we save all the slides of our events. You can use them as inspiration.
