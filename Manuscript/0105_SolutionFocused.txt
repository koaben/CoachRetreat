##Solution Focused

Help the coachee form a concrete vision of a preferred future and focus the coachee’s attention on building solutions through a structured series of questions.

###Miracle Questions

While sleeping tonight, imagine a miracle happens. Because you are sleeping you won’t be aware that anything has happened. You will have at least part of the solution (skills, knowledge, etc.) you need.
What will you notice that is different about you and how you behave?

###Exception Questions

+ Are there times when elements of your solution happen? Tell me about those.
+ Are there times when parts of ‘the miracle’ happen? Tell me about those.
+ Are there times when the problems are not occurring? Tell me about those.

Once you and the coachee have identified that some of the desired behavior does take place, at least occasionally, the advice becomes self‐evident... Do more of it!

###What else?

+ What else would you be doing?
+ What other exceptions?

###Scaling Questions

If you had to plot yourself on a continuum where ‘1’ is the worst the circumstance could reasonably be and ‘10’ is the best that the situation could be, where would you put yourself now?

###Coping Questions

+ What have you done to continue to stay patient?
+ How have you survived thus far?
+ How have you been compensating?

###In your “miracle” context:

+ “What do you think ________ would notice after ‘the miracle’ occurred?”
+ “How do you think _________ would rate you (1‐10) about your willingness to succeed at this task?” 
+ “Do you think there are times when _________ would say you are doing ___________?”
