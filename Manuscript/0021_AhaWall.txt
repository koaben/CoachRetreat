##Aha Wall

During CoachRetreat we use an aha wall to collect what was outstanding learning for the participants or anything else people want to share with each other.

It’s important to talk about the "aha-wall" during the intro of the day and during every retro session during the day. 
At the end of the day It’s a good idea to walk over to the board and read the different post it’s.
