##Scenario 4

Alan is an IT person who is very enthusiastic about Agility; He decided to go for Agile for all projects. 
His development teams are also on board and motivated to do Scrum. They had previously experience in Agile. To implement the project, they chose Muriel as a PO. She is a Business Analyst. It has been said that Agile must provide specifications as simple user stories. That could work for Alan, but actually it is not very clear: what does “simple” mean? Muriel has other responsibilities outside of her role as a PO. She does not understand how to manage the scope of the application and she cannot give priorities without prior notice from business managers; most of the time, everything is a priority.
The development team believes that User Stories are not written well enough, and Muriel is frustrated because what is demoed works only partly; the development team blame that the acceptance test are not provided, user stories are unclear and put the sprints at risk...
