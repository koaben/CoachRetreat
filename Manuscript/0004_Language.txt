##Language

 CoachRetreat has a strong rule about language, therefore the event will be hold in the local language. Conversations in coaching need a lot of focus and attention to all the subtleties of the conversations. We believe that learning to listen to someone is avery demanding already in our mothertongue. Hence he insists that CoachRetreat is organized in one language.

Of course people can follow a CoachRetreat in another language than their mothertongue. Yet we do encourage you to first follow one in your mothertongue. On the facilitator page you can find people who can help you organizing one.
