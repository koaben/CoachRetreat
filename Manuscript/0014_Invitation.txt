Subject: Invitation to Coach Retreat next week

Hi [name],

We are meeting next [Saturday, Date] for a Coach Retreat.

Overall schedule for the day:
09:00 - Breakfast and mingling
09:30 - Begin Coach Retreat
13:00 - Lunch
17:30 - Closing

Participation in this Coach Retreat is free, and participants and facilitators bring their own food to share.
Please bring your choice of breakfast, lunch and refreshments for breaks.
Hot and cold beverage will be available for participants.
As a rule of thumb, please bring enough food for yourself, so together we'll have a good amount for everyone to share.
Please also bring utensils if needed.

During the retreat, participants will work together in small groups, and each member will get a chance to act in several roles.
We kindly ask to respect opening and closing times, so work in groups is effective and successful.

The retreat will take place at:
