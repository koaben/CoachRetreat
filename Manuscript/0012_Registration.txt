##Registration

We recommend to create the registration the CoachRetreat EventBrite, as we believe this way allow each other help create a successful CoachRetreat. If you need help Yves can offer support with this.
You can find these events here: https://www.eventbrite.com/o/coachretreat-15876439539

Alternatively, you may use your registration platform of choice, such as your own EventBrite account, Meetup.com or other.

We tried an experiment (CR32) with separate tickets for women and men. With a similar experiment at CoderDojo Belgium, Yves noticed that overall diversity skyrocked. (Not just male/female %, also more none-white people subscribed. ) With CoachRetreat 32 non-binary people felt excluded. We created a separate ticket for these people, 1 subscribed, yet did  not show u. After CR32, we are back to 1 ticket.
